# TiktakToe
 
A simple HTML/javascript based game that allows you to play against a computer.

The computer does not have any advanced algorithms to decide the best move possible, but I do plan to work a bit more on it in the future.

Functions needed to implement:
1. Choosing go first or second. (or make it so that every game it alternates between who goes first)
2. Add a simple counter who won how many times (win counter)
3. Either hardcode or add algorithms so that the computer would choose the best move possible.
